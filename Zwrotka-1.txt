Although loneliness has always been a friend of mine 
I'm leaving my life in your hands 
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind 
Risking it all in a glance 
How you got me blind is still a mystery  
I can't get you out of my head 
Don't care what is written in you history 
As long as you're here with me
